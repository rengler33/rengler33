## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves to code with python, but I'm also studying the functional programming style and learning Elixir.

## [Python OOP notes](https://github.com/rengler33/python_oop)

A growing collection of notes I'm taking about design patterns in python.

## Projects


### [pydagorean](https://github.com/rengler33/pydagorean) (WIP)

A way to construct DAGs for data pipelines, built on top of networkx. Useful for writing procedural code and encourages a functional programming style.



### [cookiecutter-python-container-dev](https://github.com/rengler33/python_docker_starter) (WIP)

A (future) cookiecutter template for python projects, complete with black & isort auto-formatting, mypy and pytest checks, and pre-commit hooks for good development behaviors.


### [cookiecutter-django-psql-docker](https://github.com/rengler33/cookiecutter-django-psql-docker) (WIP)

Personal preferences for a production-ready deployment of Django projects.

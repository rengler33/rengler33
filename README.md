## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves to code with python. I'm also studying the functional programming style while learning Elixir. Other areas of study include ETL/ELT, data warehousing, AWS, terraform, and more.

## Notes

### [Python OOP notes](https://github.com/rengler33/python_oop)

A growing collection of notes I'm taking about OOP design patterns in python.


## Project Scaffolds

### [minimal-py-poetry](https://github.com/rengler33/minimal-py-poetry)

An attempt to capture docker's multi-stage build best practices while using poetry. Uses a "builder" image to install all requirements via poetry and copies them to tiny production image. Also creates a development image that still has build tools available but doesn't become part of the final image.


### [cookiecutter-python-container-dev](https://github.com/rengler33/python_docker_starter) (WIP)

A (future) cookiecutter template for python projects, complete with black & isort auto-formatting, mypy and pytest checks, and pre-commit hooks for good development behaviors.

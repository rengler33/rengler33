## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves to code with Python & Elixir. Areas of work include Django, ETL/ELT, data warehousing, AWS, terraform, and more.

## Projects

### [Game of Tafl](https://github.com/rengler33/tafl) (WIP)

An ancient game, also known as Hnefatafl or "viking's chess" written in Elixir. Includes a text client and will include a Phoenix client in the future.


## Notes

### [Python OOP notes](https://github.com/rengler33/python_oop)

A growing collection of notes I'm taking about OOP design patterns in python.


## Concise Concepts

### [minimal-py-poetry](https://github.com/rengler33/minimal-py-poetry)

An attempt to capture docker's multi-stage build best practices while using poetry. Uses a "builder" image to install all requirements via poetry and copies them to tiny production image. Also creates a development image that still has build tools available but doesn't become part of the final image.

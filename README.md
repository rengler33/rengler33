## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analyst and aspiring software engineer who loves to code.

## Projects

### [workout-mp3-generator](https://github.com/rengler33/workout-mp3-generator) (WIP)

I made a command line tool for creating audio files that contain workout instructions at specified intervals. 

You can provide an exercise descriptions, time intervals, and optionally the number of reps you need to complete. An audio file will be created for you that serves as your workout instructions and timer.


### [telegram-to-cloud](https://github.com/rengler33/telegram-to-cloud) (WIP)

I'm working on a telegram bot that can upload files sent to it to AWS or Google Drive.

## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm an analyst and aspiring software engineer who loves to code.

I have a young blog [here](https://www.rkengler.com) where I'm attempting to learn in public.

## Projects

### [cookiecutter-python-container-dev](https://github.com/rengler33/python_docker_starter) (WIP)

I'm currently experimenting with Docker container development. This involves setting up my development environment entirely inside a Docker container. In theory, this should make the process of managing the development environment "simple" for myself and any collaborators. As always, with Docker, it never feels "simple". In any case, if I like this setup I will flesh out the rest of this project into a cookiecutter template for python projects, complete with black & isort auto-formatting, mypy and pytest checks, and pre-commit hooks for good development behaviors.


### [workout-mp3-generator](https://github.com/rengler33/workout-mp3-generator) (WIP)

I made a command line tool for creating audio files that contain workout instructions at specified intervals. 

You can provide an exercise descriptions, time intervals, and optionally the number of reps you need to complete. An audio file will be created for you that serves as your workout instructions and timer.


### [telegram-to-cloud](https://github.com/rengler33/telegram-to-cloud) (WIP)

I'm working on a telegram bot that can upload files sent to it to AWS or Google Drive.

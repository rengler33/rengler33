## Hi :) ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer who loves to code with python. Currently learning Elixir.

## Projects


### [workout-mp3-generator](https://github.com/rengler33/workout-mp3-generator) (WIP)

A command line tool for creating audio files that contain workout instructions at specified intervals.

You can provide an exercise descriptions, time intervals, and optionally the number of reps you need to complete. An audio file will be created for you that serves as your workout instructions and timer.


### [cookiecutter-python-container-dev](https://github.com/rengler33/python_docker_starter) (WIP)

A (future) cookiecutter template for python projects, complete with black & isort auto-formatting, mypy and pytest checks, and pre-commit hooks for good development behaviors.


### [cookiecutter-django-psql-docker](https://github.com/rengler33/cookiecutter-django-psql-docker) (WIP)

Personal preferences for a production-ready deployment of Django projects.
